Core Java 

Object and Classes 

Since Java follows OOPs concept so we call it as OOP Language

Class are basically a blue print or the template 
Object are real time identity which is occupying some space and memory .

There are 4 OOPs concept in java 

1>Inheritance
2>Polymorphism
3>Abstraction 
4>Encapsulation


Inheritance 

Inheritance is a feature of Object Oriented PL where a child class(sub class) will have the feature of its own along with some of the features adapted from the parent (super class)

a>Single Inheritance
b>Multilevel inheritance 
c>Multiple Inheritance ----java does not directly supports , we have to use interface 
d>Hybrid Inheritance

Polymorphism (multiple forms)
Polymorphism is a concept of OOP where a single methods can be called differently in java , by some special features .
a>Compile time polymorphism ----Method Overloading
b>Run time polymorphism .----Method overriding


Abstraction 
Abstraction is a feature of OOP where we are focused only on the functional details and we dont want to have an idea for the implementation details .

a>Abstract class--- 0 to 100%
b>Interface--100%

Encapsulation 
Encapsulation is a featureof OOP where the data and methods are being binded together in such a way that they are being protected from any kind of external hampering . 
We can have various access modifiers to implement encapsulation . 
Private
Public
Protected 
Default 

public static void main(String[] args)

public --- an access modifier and once we declare this we can access it from any point of the program 

static ---> if we have declared static that means we dont have to create object ,
memory is also loaded once.

main --->  main is the starting point of the program .

new is a keyword in java used during time of object creation 

Data Types in java  Size

Inheritance 

1>Single Inheritance 
2>MultilevelInheritance
3>Method Overloading
4>Method Overriding


Abstract Class
Interface 
Static keyword

Looping

if
if else
While 
Do While
for 
for each loop 

Array 

Strings in Java
String is a an Object in Java which is a collection of characters .

String str="Saurabh";

String 

What is String
Why Immutable
String gets stored in Heap memory
Methods-

String Buffer class

Exception handling in Java 

Exception are the events which occur during the execution of the program and it disrupts the 
normal flow of execution , 
The process of Handling Exceptions in java is called Exception Handling 

1>Compile time Exception----Checked Exception
2>Run Time Exception -----Unchecked Exception

 


try catch
throw
throws
finally

Taking input output from User

ScannerInput class
BufferedReader class
InputStream class


Advance Java 

Collections interface 

Collections are basically those which are used to manipulate and store a group of objects .


List
ArrayList
LinkedList
STack
Queue

Set
HashSet
LinkedHashSet
TreeSet

Map
HashMap
LinkedHashMap
TreeMap
